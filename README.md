------------------
This is a Customizable Boilerplate WordPress Plugin that is developed as a single-page app with Vue js and Vite. You don't have to reload the page all the time.
Read the <a href="https://github.com/hasanuzzamanbe/wp-boilerplate-vue-with-vite/#make-your-own-plugin-from-boilerplate-within-10-sec-quick-setup-%EF%B8%8F">Detailed quick setup</a> can help to make a new fresh plugin within 10 sec

### Project Structure
The boilerplate follows an MVC-like architecture with a clean folder structure:

```
app/
  Foundation/      # Core framework classes
    Activator.php  # Plugin activation handler
    LoadAssets.php # Asset management
    Route.php      # Routing system
    Vite.php       # Vite integration
  Http/
    Controllers/   # Request handlers and business logic
      Controller.php # Abstract base controller
  Models/          # Data models and database interactions
    Model.php      # Abstract base model
    Post.php       # Example model implementation
routes/
  web.php         # Route definitions
resources/              # Frontend Vue application
  admin/          # Admin panel components
```

### Routing System
The plugin uses a Laravel-inspired routing system. Define your routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/api/posts', [PostController::class], 'index');
Route::post('/api/posts', [PostController::class], 'store');
```

### Models and Controllers
Extend the abstract Model class to create your data models:

```php
class Post extends Model {
    protected $table = 'posts';
}
```

Controllers handle the business logic and respond to requests:

```php
class PostController extends Controller {
    public function index() {
        return Post::all();
    }
}
```

### How faster is Vite than the Webpack in development?
It needs milliseconds to update the dom, [Check very short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA3G8ahoHLE)

# Development Helping Docs:

### Enqueue Assets:
Now easy enqueue from version 1.0.6
No need to worry about the dev environment enqueue or Production level enqueue.
everything here can be managed by Vite dedicated class (`includes/Foundation/Vite.php`)

Just Call like this

`Vite::enqueueScript($enqueueTag, $yourAdminSourcePath, $dependency = [], $version = null, $inFooter = false)`

Note: same as `wp_enqueue_script`

### Example use case:
<p style="color: green;">
No need to enqueue production manually again, It will enqueue from manifest on production. Just call `Vite::enqueueScript()`</p>

`Vite::enqueueScript('my-plugin-script-boot', 'js/admin/main.js', [], PLUGIN_CONST_VERSION, true)`

`Vite::enqueueStyle('my-plugin-style', 'scss/my-style.js', array(), PLUGIN_CONST_VERSION, true)`

<details>
  <summary>NOT RECOMMENDED wp_enqueue_script (see why)</summary>

If you want to use `wp_enqueue_script` then you have to call both dev and production manually:

(Production and dev enqueue script should be like this)

```
if (defined('PLUGIN_CONST_DEVELOPMENT') && PLUGIN_CONST_DEVELOPMENT !== 'yes') {
    wp_enqueue_script('pluginlowercase-script-boot', PLUGIN_CONST_URL . 'assets/js/main.js', [], PLUGIN_CONST_VERSION, false);
} else {
    wp_enqueue_script('pluginlowercase-script-boot', 'http://localhost:8880/' . 'resources/js/admin/main.js', [], PLUGIN_CONST_VERSION, true);
}
```
